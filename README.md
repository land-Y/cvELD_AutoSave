# Overview
This is an autosave tool that works with Blender 3.x.
Blender autosave does not work depending on environment or situation.
It is a mysterious specification. What is it? Is it because the data is stored in the network?

In such a case, this tool is for you.

How to use:
After installing the add-on, specify the auto save timer.
It will not work with a new scene that has not been saved at all.
Be sure to save the scene somewhere.
That's all.
