# Overview
Summary
This is an automatic saving tool for Blender 3.x. Sometimes, due to environmental or situational factors, Blender's auto-save feature might not work. This could be puzzling, and could potentially be due to storing data on a network.

This tool is perfect for such situations.

Instructions:
After installing the add-on, you need to specify an auto-save timer. Please note, the tool will not function if you are working on a new scene that hasn't been saved anywhere yet. Make sure to save your scene somewhere. That's it. Enjoy your work without the fear of losing progress!
